# Bottles/FubuMVC Example 

This is a dead-simple example project I put together while I was learning how to use the [Bottles](http://bottles.fubu-project.org/) library in a [FubuMVC](http://mvc.fubu-project.org/) application. It consists of a simple 'Hello, World' bottle and a simple FubuMVC web application that dynamically loads the bottle. 

I put this together as a learning exercise for myself, and I figured it might be able to help others who are pretty sure that the Bottles library is what they need but who can't find a good example to get started with it.

Please let me know via the issues section if any part of it is confusing, wrong, or doesn't seem to work for you. I want this to be as clear an example as it can be. 

As I get deeper into using these frameworks for my own projects, hopefully I'll be able to add more complex examples to demonstrate others features.
